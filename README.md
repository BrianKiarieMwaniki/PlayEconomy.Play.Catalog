This is a microservice I am building with .NET as part of a learning tutorial with Julio Casal. After taking his free course on youtube, I decided to spring for the 
paid tutorial because it offers much more than the free tutorial.

## Things I hope to learn:
  1. Kubernetes
  2. Docker with .NET
  3. Deploying Microservices with Kubernetes, docker and github actions with CI/CD to Azure Cloud
  
## Things I am adopting
Writing unit tests and integration tests
